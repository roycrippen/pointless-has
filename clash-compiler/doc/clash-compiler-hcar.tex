% (WHAT IS IT?)
The first line of the package description on hackage is:
\begin{quote}
C$\lambda$aSH (pronounced 'clash') is a functional hardware description language that borrows its syntax and semantics from the functional programming language Haskell.
\end{quote}

In essence, however, it is a combination of:
\begin{itemize}
  \item A Haskell library containing data types and functions for circuit design: \url{http://hackage.haskell.org/package/clash-prelude}.
  \item A compiler that transforms the Haskell code to low-level synthesisable VHDL or SystemVerilog: \url{http://hackage.haskell.org/package/clash-ghc}.
\end{itemize}
Of course, the compiler cannot transform arbitrary Haskell code to hardware, but only the \emph{structural} subset of Haskell.
This subset is vaguely described as the \emph{semantic} subset of Haskell from which a \emph{finite} structure can be inferred, and hence excludes unbounded recursion.
The C$\lambda$aSH compiler is thus a proper compiler (based on static analysis), and \emph{not} an embedded Domain Specific Language (DSL) such as Kansas Lava~\cite{klava}.

% (WHAT IS ITS STATUS? / WHAT HAS HAPPENED SINCE LAST TIME?)
C$\lambda$aSH has been in active development since 2010, and its last entry in HCAR was in 2011 \url{http://www.haskell.org/communities/05-2011/html/report.html#sect7.5.1}.
Since then we have significantly improved stability, enlarged the subset of transformable Haskell, improved performance of the compiler, and added SystemVerilog generation.
And, perhaps most importantly, vastly improved documentation.

% (CAN OTHERS GET IT?)
C$\lambda$aSH is available on hackage, for GHC version 7.10 and higher:
\begin{verbatim}
$ cabal update
$ cabal install clash-ghc
\end{verbatim}

% (WHAT ARE THE IMMEDIATE PLANS?)
Development plans for C$\lambda$aSH are:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Behavioural synthesis of unbounded recursion (by Ingmar te Raa).
  \item Use a dependently typed internal core language, so that we can use both Haskell/GHC and Idris \url{http://http://www.idris-lang.org/} as \emph{front-end} language for circuit design (by Christiaan Baaij).
\end{itemize}
